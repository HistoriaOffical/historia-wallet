			Using this dialog, you can request coins from another person (who should already have installed Historia Wallet).
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you can enter an amount of Historia to request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, you either have the generated QR code scanned by the payer.
			Or, you can send your request to a remote person with the share button in the action bar.
			If both phones have NFC enabled, you can also tap them together.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either way, the payer will be presented a dialog for sending coins with all fields pre-populated.

			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Historia URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the Historia address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Historia addresses or Historia requests by pressing the QR button.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Historia you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.

		<p>
			Tap InstantSend if you intend to make an instant payment.  The fee is higher (> 0.001 HTA).
			Last, you enter the amount to pay and the spending PIN must be entered if one was set up beforehand.

			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Historia Wallet.
			If you want a payment to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN).

			Note:
			Payments are irreversible!
			Always check the receiving address.
